# hello-world

Hi Im Jocelyn G. Ruedas, 19 years old. Taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at the University of Cebu Main campus.  
I donâ€™t usually tell how great and wonderful i am but let me tell you i am very proud of myself, I'm still in the middle of my story. While one of us know the happiness/sadness and trials we have yet to encounter, we do know that Jesus will be with us through them all. We can be confident that one day after the last chapter is written, our story will be tied up with a bow in the most glorious way possible.
